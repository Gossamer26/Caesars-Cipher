Caesars Cipher

This is a simple JavaScript function to apply Caesar's Cipher to a given string.

## Description

Caesar's Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project provides a function `rot13()` which applies a Caesar cipher with a shift of 13 places (ROT13) to a given string.

## Usage

To use the `rot13()` function, simply call it with a string parameter. For example:

```javascript
console.log(rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC")); // Output: "FREE CODE CAMP"
